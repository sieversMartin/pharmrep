MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the PharmRep Bundle, the "Work" is the collection of the 
following 10 files:

README.md           --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt        --  the file you are reading now
pharmrep.dtx        --  main source file
pharmrep.ins        --  installation script
sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc -- Color profile
ICC_LICENSE.txt     -- License for color profile
ctanlion.pdf        --  graphic file used for the documentation
LatexCTD.pdf        --  graphic file used for the documentation
pdfexample.pdf      --  graphic file used for the documentation
TexStudioBiber.jpg  --  graphic file used for the documentation


If you have received the 10 files listed above, you possess an integral copy 
of the PharmRep Bundle.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the PharmRep Bundle, a "Compiled Work" is the collection of:

a) the following 4 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

README.md
manifest.txt
sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc
ICC_LICENSE.txt


AND
b) the following 4 files:

pharmrep.cls          --  LaTeX document class
pharmrep.pdf          --  class documentation
pharmrep-template.tex --  template for article
pharmrep-template.bib --  template for bibliography

The file `pharmrep.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the 
program pdflatex the file `pharmrep.dtx', following the same steps as 
those explained in `README.md' under the title "How to generate the 
documentation".



COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of the 
PharmRep Bundle, it suffices to distribute only the 10 files that constitute 
the "Work".
